    The XML file structure is rather fragile and must be very precisely maintained.
    No extra whitespace is allowed to space apart tags.

    In your trailhead playground, there are a number of metadata types that already have configurations that will be pulled.
    You want to make sure you don't pull these extra, useless configurations you did not make as it will bloat your
    project and cause all manner of problems. Unless the metadata type already uses the * operator, DO NOT USE IT.
    This is especially the case on metadata types that specifically say not to retrieve all.

    DO NOT get lazy and use "automatic manifest generator" extensions/programs. This WILL screw up your file and make it 10x
    harder and I will feel no sympathy because I told you not to. Instead, whenever you create a feature that does not automatically
    pull all files of that metadata type, update this file with the new entry.

    In order to look through the total list of all metadata types, here is the documentation link:
    https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_types_list.htm

    If your feature is not getting pulled, look at the above list and see if this manifest file includes it. If not, add it as
    a new entry in its own <types></types> element. Make sure not to leave any <types></types> elements empty. Warnings that
    may display in the console do not prevent metadata from being pulled/deployed.

    To deploy using your manifest:
    sfdx force:source:deploy -x ./path/to/package.xml

    To retrieve using your manifest:
    sfdx force:source:retrieve -x ./path/to/package.xml

    Remember: This file will ONLY retrieve metadata, it will NOT retrieve any records that are in your org.
